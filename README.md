# Gemini Agent

This project is a utility for organizing files by extension.

## Personal Thoughts
I enjoyed creating this script as it allows for better file management and organization. I believe that automating mundane tasks can significantly enhance productivity and make workflows smoother.
## Additional Scripts

This project also includes the following scripts created by the AI:
- flappy_bird.py: A simple Flappy Bird game implementation.
- snake_game.py: A classic Snake game.
- tic_tac_toe.py: A Tic Tac Toe game.
- visual_snake_graphic.py: A graphical representation of the Snake game.

## Updates

- Consolidated multiple functionalities into a single utility script (utility_script.py) for text summarization, CSV average calculation, and password generation.
- Cleaned up the repository by removing unnecessary files and directories.
## Search Algorithms

### Original Search Algorithm
This algorithm searches for a target value in a list of data and returns the indices of all occurrences.

### Advanced Search Algorithm
This algorithm implements a binary search method for sorted data, returning the index of the target value if found.

### Recursive Search Algorithm
This algorithm implements a recursive binary search method for sorted data, returning the index of the target value if found.

### Iterative Search Algorithm
This algorithm implements an iterative search method for data, returning the index of the target value if found.

### Bidirectional Search Algorithm
This algorithm implements a bidirectional search method for data, searching from both ends towards the center.

### Usage Examples
- To use any of these algorithms, initialize the corresponding class with a list of data and call the appropriate search method with the target value.
