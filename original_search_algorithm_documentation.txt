        Original Search Algorithm
        -------------------------
        This algorithm searches for a target value in a list of data.
        It returns the indices of all occurrences of the target value.

        Usage:
        1. Initialize the algorithm with a list of data.
        2. Call the search method with the target value.
        3. The method returns a list of indices where the target is found.
