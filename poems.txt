1. Whispering Winds
In the quiet of the night,
Whispering winds take flight,
Carrying dreams on their wings,
Softly, the moonlight sings.

2. Dancing Leaves
Leaves that twirl and sway,
In the gentle breeze, they play,
Nature's dance, a vibrant show,
Painting colors in a flow.

3. Stars Above
Stars above, so bright and clear,
Guiding hearts that wander near,
In the vastness, hope ignites,
A tapestry of endless nights.
